        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>In the modern age of computing, three important things that have impacted computing was/is Pong, Steve Jobs,and Bill Gates. These three people/items are the reason why computers
            have become what they are in the modern age.
        </p>
        <h3> Short History on Pong</h3>
        <p>Pong was one of the first video games in the industry. Pong was created in 1972 and was under the company known as Atari. Atari released a home version of Pong through the store
            known as Sears. The success of Pong assisted in the first mass production of a console and has even hit the pop culture of America at the time. Pong has been referenced many
            times by television shows and other video games.
        </p>

        <h3>Short Description of Steve Jobs</h3>
        <p>Steve Jobs was the CEO of Apple and is known as the one of many important pioneers in the microcomputer revolution. Steve
            Jobs produced their first personal computer with the assistance of Steve Wozniak known as Apple 1. The year after, they gave gained wealth and fame off of the Apple 2.
            The Apple 2 was one of the first highly successful mass produced personal computer. Jobs was able to release many more computers, such as the Apple Lisa, and the successful
            Apple Macintosh.  Jobs then founded a company known as NeXT, which developed computers for businesses and other high class or professional groups.

        <h3> Summary of Bill Gates</h3>
        <p>Moving on, the other important man in the history of computers is Bill Gates. He is the reason why our computers are the way they are today; from OS structure, to programs,
            to personal computers, Gates impacted the computer industry as much, if not more, than Steve Jobs. Bill Gates is the CEO of Microsoft, an entrepreneur. Investor and computer
            programmer. Microsoft was co-founded with Paul Allen in 1975, which is now known as the largest computer software company. Gates was the largest shareholder of Microsoft up until
            2014. Bill Gates’ early life was mainly revolved around computers and the algorithms he made or saw. While in Harvard, Bill Gates focused on the usage of their computer rather
            than having a definite study plan. Gates and Allen join Honeywell in 1974, however, they left the year after to start their own company after seeing the release of MITS Altair
            8800. Bill Gates assisted in developing the BASIC interpreter with the assistance of MITS. Gates saw that ninety percent of users of the Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for
            their service. After 1976, Microsoft became independent of MITS and continued to develop computer programming language software for various systems.

        <p>Bill Gates partnered up with IBM to assist in releasing the IBM PC, which would be run on an OS known as 86 DOS, the name was changed after Bill Gates received full ownership of
            86 DOS, which he refers to as PC DOS. The IBM PC’s were released with PC DOS, which was similar platform to CP/M operating system for the one-time fee of 50,000 dollars. After.
            The sales of what was known as the MS DOS was becoming popular. Although IBM had its name on the computers, people were referring to Bill Gates as “the man behind the machine”.
            Many others then started to identify Microsoft as the most influential group to the new computer IBM created. Gates then continued to grow and flourish in the computer software
            industry and Microsoft soon grew to become one of the most known and renowned computer companies.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Pong assisted in creating the gaming industry of computers and consoles as we know it. This was due to the programmers of 1972. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates both assisted in
            creating and innovating on computers physically,  software wise, and program wise. Both men have created programs and software we still use to this day, and continue to innovate
            in the computer industry.As a result of these 3 important figures/items, the computer software industry was able to grow into other categories such as gaming, programming,
            developing, and general use.
